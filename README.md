Emily: Good afternoon. TBH Network Solutions


Fred: Yeah, hi. My system is down and I need to speak with a technician.


Emily: Oh, okay. Let me gather some information and see if we can help. What is your first name?


Fred: Fred.


Emily: And your last name; would you spell it for me please?


Fred: Sure. It’s C-H-A-M-B-E-R-S, Chambers.


Emily: Okay. And your company name?


Fred: I’m with GoldStar Environmental.


Emily: GoldStar Environmental?


Fred: Yes ma’am.


Emily: Okay. And your callback number?
Fred: 610-265-1715.
Emily: That’s 610-265-1715?
Fred: Yes.
Emily: Okay. And what seems to be the problem today?
Fred: My agents aren’t able to make or receive any telephone calls.
Emily: Okay and what type of system do you have
Fred: I have AmStar700, I think.
Emily: Alright. Are you able to log on to the system?
Fred: No, actually, I can’t even get an Internet connection.
Emily: mm..hmmm. According to my records, the AmStar700 is a voiceover Internet protocol phone. It appears         that because your Internet isn’t working, your phones are not working as well. Do you know who your Internet provider is?
Fred: I have Verizon.
Emily: Okay. Mr. Chambers, I’m going to get a hold of Randy, and have him return your call. Is the 610-265-1715 a good number to reach you at right now?
Fred: Yeah that’s my cell. That is working.
Emily: Okay, great. In the meantime, see if you can reach out to Verizon and let them know your issue. And Randy should be calling you back shortly.
Fred: Thank you very much for your help.
Emily: You’re welcome. Thank you. Goodbye.
Fred: Take care. Goodbye.
